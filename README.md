## Installation 
Copy and clone the repo [README Generator](https://github.com/Kubikubiessa/readme-generator).
Then install the package.json for the necessary npm dependencies (inquirer) by running `npm init -y`. 
Then run `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` for installing the right version of inquirer, which allows us to use the command line as prompt interface. 
Then run the the README-generator by running the index.js file in your command line: `node index.js`.

## Usage
Following the command line prompts, you can generate a professional README file that includes title, table of contents, information for installation, usage, testing, and contributing. Finally, you choose your license under which your project is published. Aside from inquirer, the application `fs` to write the markdown file (`fs.writeFile`).
